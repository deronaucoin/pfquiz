This repo houses my responses to the pre-interview home questions for Practice Fusion. 

The SQL section answers are found under sqlqueries.sql.

The programming section is handled in PFQuiz.py. Aside from the numpy library, it only requires the data files exist in a 
/data directory off the script's directory.

The two files for the visualization are found in /viz. I wanted to use this opportunity to learn 
something about d3. However, I am not entirely pleased at the result. What you see is a copy and modify of the 
awesome "Les Mis√©rables Co-occurrence" visualization of the characters in the musical. 
You can find his great work here: http://bost.ocks.org/mike/miserables/

Note, I had to transform your matrix.txt into a d3 json file. There are some python scripts around to help with that. 
I posted the one I used in the folder also: transform.py.

Also, d3 wants the two files to be served across http, so you can drop them in your own share or view my dump here: http://www.deronaucoin.com/viz/datavizpf.html

The quantitative reasoning questions are answered in the similarly named pdf file.

Finally, there is a short pdf of some health data research ideas. To be honest, my surgical resident girlfiend had some
nice input here. She acted like a kid in the candy store when I explained the amount and types of data that Practice Fusion
may have access to. 

All the best, 

Deron
