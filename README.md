This repo houses my responses to the interview questions for Practice Fusion. 

The SQL section answers are found under sqlqueries.sql.

The programming section is handled in PFQuiz.py. 

The two files for the viszulationa seciton are found in /viz. I wanted to use this opportunity to learn 
something about d3. However, I am not entirely pleased at the result. What you see if a copy and modify of the 
awesome "Les Mis√©rables Co-occurrence" of characters in the musical. You can find his great work here: http://bost.ocks.org/mike/miserables/

The quantitative reasoning questions are answered in the similarly named doc file.

Finally, there is a short doc of some health data research ideas. To be honest, my surgical resident girlfiend has some
nice input here. She acted like a kid in the candy store when I explained the amount and types of data that Practice Fusion
may have access to. 

All the best, 

Deron
